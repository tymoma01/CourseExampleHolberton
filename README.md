# CourseExampleHolberton. 

This repository is made to give some clues to the students at the beginning of the week.  
Each folder is made for teaching purposes following the curriculum made by Holberton.  

This repo does not aim at giving the student answers, it aims at giving them the tools to understand the notions at stake during the start of the week.
